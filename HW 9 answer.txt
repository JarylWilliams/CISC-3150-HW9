The reason why the program died without throwing any exceptions because the NotifyAll method was throwing an unchecked exception. 
NotifyAll wakes up the threads but it doesn’t unlock them. The threads are in a lock but never gets unlocked.
The solution to this problem will be to use the synchronized keyword for the consumer and producer methods.
